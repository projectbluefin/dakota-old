[Bluefin's](https://projectbluefin.io) final form. 

> How dare you.

`projectbluefin/dakota` is built on [GNOME OS](https://os.gnome.org/). This is a prototype and not ready and may bite.

## Status

- Consume GNOME nightly bootc image (done)
- Final assembly in this repo (done)

## Future Layout

- Consume GNOME buildstream definitions and apply Bluefin changes:
  - Bluefin buildstream definitions [@projectbluefin/egg](https://github.com/projectbluefin/egg)
- Final assembly in this repo

## Goals

- No dx image, everything in homebrew or sysexts

## Missing things

- Installation
- Ensuring upgrades and rollbacks work

## Get started
    git clone https://github.com/projectbluefin/dakota.git
    cd dakota
    just show-me-the-future

Will build and run Bluefin in a VM. This image is based on GNOME50 so most of the desktop Bluefin changes don't work. The automation is in place though, just check back often to see progress.
